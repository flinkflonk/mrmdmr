"Michael's Read My DMarc Reports" - an automatic way of reading the XML reports other DMARC installations send you and alert you to everything that is not normal.

The name is intended to be difficult to write, because this is a script that should be included in some automatic way of handling mail to postmaster.
In other words, don't run this from the command line.
